## What this is used for

This is basically just a glorified Todo-List.

You can create action plans, which are just templates.
You can then execute an action plan and just check one item after the other, which will also record the date and time.

We use this for maintenance or setting up new PCs so we don't forget any steps.

## Installation

You can deploy this app using Docker.
Take a look at the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) for a simple reference.

## Tech Stack

This is built with Rust, SQLx and HTML templates.
